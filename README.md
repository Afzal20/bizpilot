## Billing and Plan Controls

BizPilot strictly enforces plan limits in the product, guides users along the appropriate upgrade path, and uses Stripe Checkout for subscriptions.

| Free-Plan Usage Limit | Upgrade Checkout |
|---|---|
| ![Client limit reached on the Free plan](docs/assets/screenshots/billing/free-plan-client-limit.png) | ![Stripe Checkout for a BizPilot subscription](docs/assets/screenshots/billing/stripe-checkout.png) |

| Active Pro Subscription | Active Enterprise Subscription |
|---|---|
| ![Active Pro plan billing page](docs/assets/screenshots/billing/pro-plan-active-billing.png) | ![Active Enterprise plan billing page](docs/assets/screenshots/billing/enterprise-active-billing.png) |

Additional plan-limit, feature-lock, checkout, and upgrade-flow captures are kept in [`docs/assets/screenshots/billing/`](docs/assets/screenshots/billing/).

## Repository Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docs/` | Product and engineering documentation (SaaS readiness report, QA analysis, Django migration plan) |
| `docs/assets/screenshots/app/` | Curated application interface screenshots showcasing all views and workflows |
| `docs/assets/screenshots/billing/` | Product screenshots for billing, checkout, plan limits, and entitlement flows |
| `backend/` | Django 5/6 + DRF API server (cookiecutter-django scaffold with PostgreSQL, Redis, and Celery) |
| `invoive_generator-next/` | Next.js frontend application (App Router, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Lucide icons) |
| `cookiecutter-config.yaml` | Reproducible cookiecutter-django scaffold configuration |

---

## Backend Quickstart

See `backend/README.md` for the full guide. Short version (Docker):

```bash
cd backend
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up
```

Local (non-Docker) smoke check:

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
env USE_DOCKER=no DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3 uv run python manage.py migrate
env USE_DOCKER=no DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3 uv run pytest
```

Note: the bundled `sites` data migration is Postgres-specific; on SQLite fake it with `uv run python manage.py migrate sites --fake`. Production uses PostgreSQL via Docker Compose (Postgres 16 + Redis + Mailpit).

---

## Frontend Quickstart

The Next.js frontend is located in `invoive_generator-next/`:

```bash
cd invoive_generator-next
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`, communicating with the backend API running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

---

## Internationalization (English + Bangla)

- Supported languages are declared in `config/settings/base.py` (`LANGUAGES`).
- `LocaleMiddleware` resolves the language from cookie / `Accept-Language`.
- Source strings are marked in templates (`{% translate %}`) and Python (`gettext_lazy`).
- Bangla catalog: `locale/bn/LC_MESSAGES/django.po` (compiled `.mo` is committed so CI/production need no gettext).

After adding or changing translatable strings:

```bash
python manage.py makemessages -l bn --ignore=.venv/* --ignore=staticfiles/*
# ...fill in translations in locale/bn/LC_MESSAGES/django.po...
python manage.py compilemessages
```

Users switch language via the navbar selector (POSTs to `/i18n/setlang/`, the Django `set_language` view).

---

## Admin Theme (django-unfold)

The admin uses [django-unfold](https://unfoldadmin.com). `"unfold"` is listed before `django.contrib.admin` in `INSTALLED_APPS`, and admin classes inherit `unfold.admin.ModelAdmin` (e.g. `UserAdmin(auth_admin.UserAdmin, ModelAdmin)`). Registrations/fieldsets structure is unchanged — only base classes differ.

---
